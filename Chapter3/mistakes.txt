3-3.js
	- Huge mistake in implementation, I had top and length parameters on my setOfStacks
		- Made everything so much harder and complicated
		- Instead just check if the current stack is empty and if so move to the prev one
3-5.js
	- Forgetting to add return statements
3-6.js
	- Instead of checking with node.data, kept checking with node itself (resulting in incorrect stacks)
