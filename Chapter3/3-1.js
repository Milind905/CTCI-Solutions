Question
Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.
* OK didn't really understand this question, I would have to ask my interviewer 
a bunch of questions to clarify this.

My clarification questions and assumptions
1) What do the three stacks have to contain?
2) Does the array have atleast three elements?
3) Can the stacks contain the same elements?
4) Why am I doing this?
5) Wut.
