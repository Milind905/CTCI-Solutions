1-1.js
	Forgot to intialize all charArr values to 0
	Forgot to check for null input, empty string, string with 1 character, string with whitespaces on the ends
	Should use a hashset implementation

1-2.js
	Didn't convert string to array, Strings are immutable!!
	When getting last element of array, do (length-1)

1-4.js
	Created an extra array where I didn't need one

1-6a.js
	Did a counter clockwise 90degree rotation instead of clockwise
1-6b.js
	No need to add a "completed field" to each matrix value if using Ceil and Floor values

1-8.js
	Split s2 into an array before finding rotate which is unnecessary
